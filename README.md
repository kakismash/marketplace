# Marketplace

Marketplace embedded system with the ability to integrate with any platform.

## How to use it

## Step 1:
In your main folder of this angular project run `ng build market-place`.

This command will generate a folder named **dist** and if everything worked correctly this message will appear in the console:

![Run Build Success](https://github.com/jantvb/json/blob/main/market-place/run-build-done.jpg)

You will have the following distribution of folders and files within **dist**:

![Run Build Success](https://github.com/jantvb/json/blob/main/market-place/dist-folder-tree.jpg)

**Note:** The names of the **main**, **polyfills**, **runtime**, **scripts** and **css** files may change, since when doing build it will always generate new names

## Step 2:


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
